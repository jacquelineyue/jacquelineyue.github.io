        <p class="xs-mb1 xs-mt4 bold">Situation</p>
        <p>BuzzFeed content creators wanted to experiment with simple game formats
          that are fun and shareable. After the breakout success of the quiz format,
          our editors are looking for more playful ways to connect with the audiences.
        </p>
        <p class="xs-mb1 xs-mt6 bold">Solution</p>
        <p class="xs-text-display xs-text-1">
          Create a collection of turn-key game formats for mobile and desktop that is
          easy to make and adapt for different content.
        </p>
        <p>
          Along three engineers, a producer, and an illustrator who also have experienced
          in making games, I led the UX design and collaborated with editors to explore
          a wide range of light-weight game formats. Over the course of 12 months, we
          prototyped 15 turn-key formats and published over 60 games. For the most
          popular games, we also created a backend game maker tool that allows content
          creators to generate their own games. Here are some of my favorite formats:

        <p>
          With an average of 30-40% completion rate, many games went on becomes a huge hit.
          Although our audiences, as well as our editors, love the game products, each project
          required too much effort to keep up the incoming demands. On one end, our team
          struggled to keep the games performant on mobile and desktop, as well as shareable
          across the social platforms.  On another end, our content creators are frustrated
          that they couldn't experiment ideas on their own at a faster pace.
        </p>
        <p>
          After 12 months of experimentation phase, the strategy was shifted to scale up a few
          successful formats by integrating them into our in-house content management system.
          The game team got dissolved and some of the OG team members joined the bigger CMS team to
          incorporate those popular formats as part of the publishing workflow.
