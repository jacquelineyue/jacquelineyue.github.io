        <p>
            BuzzFeed creates and publishes over 600+ videos, posts, and graphics a week to our owned &
            operated properties and many social platforms like Facebook or Snapchat. We get data back about
            how our content connects with our audiences from metrics like pageviews, shares, and minutes watched.
            The knowledge held in those data helps us to understand what resonates with our audiences,
            and as a result, powers the feedback loop ( Iterate &#10141; Publish &#10141; Learn )
            for our content creators to make better, more engaging content.

        <p>
            Data plays an integral role in our editorial and advertising strategy. My team Reporting Tools
            was formed 2 years ago and tasked with this mission:

            Empower the organization to make data-driven decisions with a suite of analytic tools

        <p class="xs-mb1 xs-mt6 bold">My role</p>
        <p>
            I lead design for 11 dashboards and features in the tool suite. As one of the 3 leads
            for the Reporting Tools team, I partner closely with the engineering and data science lead to
            define the product strategy, roadmap and KPIs. For the last 12 months, I also lead the product
            and ship the audience x content dashboard, video translation reporting, Facebook platform
            monitoring feature, and user preference workflow.

              The demand for data was higher than ever, however accessing data is a tedious process.
              There was no easy way to get data to answer simple questions. Users spent more time on
              cobbling stats from multiple sources than making data analysis. Our data analysts
              were drowned by requests from different parts of the company and unable to keep up the
              demand. Because of the high friction to get data, many people simply gave up or
              resorted to a subjective way to set goals and make decisions.

                over 500+ active users a month, people rely on our tools to access data for making
                strategic decisions, reporting, and brainstorming every day. For each launch, we would get
                a swamp of email with positive reactions and occasional bug reports like this:

                The user-friendless and speed of El Dashboard have earned a good reputation within the company.
                We recently expand our user base to support the business and advertising division (~200 users).
                They have switched their old workflow to use our tools for creative pitch and ideation with
                brands. Even our business data analyst loves our product:

                The dashboard enables our content creators to learn and experiment at a rapid pace so they can create
                engaging, shareable content one after another. One example is this
                <a class="link-charcoal" href="https://www.facebook.com/officialgoodful/videos/1300037320066731/">
                video of growing vegetable scraps </a>
                which garnered 6.6M shares lead to many up-cycling videos the BuzzFeed audiences love and enjoy.
