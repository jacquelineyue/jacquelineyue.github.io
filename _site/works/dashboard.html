            BuzzFeed creates and publishes over 500+ videos, posts, and graphics a week to our owned
            & operated properties and many social platforms like Facebook or Snapchat. We get data
            back about how our content connects with our audiences from metrics like pageviews,
            shares, and retweets. The knowledge held in this data helps us to understand what resonates
            with them; consequently powers the feedback loop: Create &#10141; Publish &#10141; Learn &#10141;
            Iterate.) for our content creators to make better, more engaging content.

            Data plays an integral role to our editorial and business strategy. My team Reporting Tools
            was formed 18 months ago and tasked with this mission:
            <span class="bold">
            Empower the entire organization to make data-driven decisions with a suite of analytic tools
            that are built by a dedicated team of product managers, engineers, designers and data-scientist
            that are hyper-focused and adaptable to meet the ever-changing needs from our editorial and
            business users.
            <span>
        </p>
        <p>
            As the sole designer in the Reporting Tools team, I lead the design and execution of all
            the dashboards, slack notification, and training collaterals. More recently, I also take on
            product mangement role in driving the strategy and vision for Search, Audience dashboard and
            improvements on the Content Insights dashboards.

          <p>The demand for data is growing drastically. Our data analysts were drowned by requests from different
              parts of the company and unable to keep up the demand. For the data consumers, accessing data was
              tedious. People spent more time hunting down data or cobbling stat from 3rd party tools and spreadsheets
              than making the analysis. Because of the high friction to access data, many folks gave up and resorted
              to subjective ways to set goals and make tactical decisions. There was no consistent way to measure
              content success that actually helps drive impact to the company.

              Create the first content insight dashbaords that addressed those pain points by providing
              key performance metrics for a given piece of content. The table-based design powered by a set
              of robust filters, search and sorting, is efficient and flexible for exploring the large dataset.
              Users can look up “What are the most popular videos about Béyonce?”, or “What are the most
              commented news post from last week?”, and then drill down to dive into the detail stats.

                Known as the Content List, the first dashboard we built was based on an
                assumption that a one-size-fill-all product would satisfy everyone's needs. The
                unclear use case along with the unforeseen engineering challenge forced us to
                kill the dashboard shortly after its completion. Since then, our team learned to be
                critical of product decisions, and evaluated every project by the user impact and
                team effort before design and development.

            Most of the outstanding content and viral hits that are beloved by our audience is a result of
            content experimentation. However, tracking the performance for any custom grouping of content
            based on a common subject or intent remained very difficult. Editorial leads often resorted to
            a manual process to log the data into a spreadsheet and aggregate the result.

        <p>
            Despite easy access to data and detect outliers, our editorial leaders have a hard time tracking
            the overall health and long-term trends of our core distribution platforms, like BuzzFeed's owned
            and operated and Facebook. As the audience's media consumption and the distributed platform is
            evolving quite a bit in the past year, able to optimize our content outputs to maximize the returns
            in audience engagement becomes critical to our business.

        <p><span class="bold xs-text-2 xs-text-display xs-mb1">The goal at the time: </span>
            Provide tools to monitor the health of the core distributed platforms that enables our management

            editorial and distribution strategy to adjust the market changes.

        <p><span class="bold xs-text-2 xs-text-display xs-mb1">Solutions: </span>
            Develop a health platform dashboard for Facebook and O&O our two main distribution platforms.
            The dashboard consists of several time-series graphs that track the content output and the key
            engagement metrics side-by-side. Most of the metrics have a strong correlation where the changes
            in one metric could reveal the changes in another. One of the novels features is pinning, which
            let users click and mark any date across all graphs so the user can compare the changes of those
            metrics across the same point in time.
