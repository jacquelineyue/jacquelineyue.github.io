        <p>BuzzFeed content creators wanted to experiment with simple game formats
          that are fun and shareable. After the breakout success of the quiz format,
          they are looking for more playful ways to connect with the audiences.

          Create a collection of turn-key game formats for mobile and desktop that is
          easy to make and adapt for different content.
        </p>
        <p>
          Along with a producer, an illustrator and 4 engineers who also have experienced
          in buildng games in the past, I led the UX design and collaborated with content
          creators to explore a wide range of game ideas. Over the course of 12 months, we
          prototyped 15 formats and published over 60 games. For the most popular games,
          we also created a game building tool that enables the content creators to generate
          their own games. Here are some of my favorite formats:

          With an average of 45% completion rate, many games went on becomes a huge hit.
          Although our audiences and content creators loved the games, each project
          required a lot of effort to execute, and our team had a hard time keeping up the
          demands. Our team struggled to ship high-quality games that were performant on
          mobile and desktop, and shareable across the social platforms. Our content
          creators were frustrated that they couldn't experiment ideas on their own
          at a faster pace.
        </p>
        <p>
          After 12 months of experimentation phase, the strategy was shifted to scale up a few
          successful formats by integrating them into BuzzFeed‚Äôs in-house content management
          system. A few of the game team crews joined the bigger CMS team to integrate those
          popular formats as part of the publishing workflow.
