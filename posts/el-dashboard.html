<!-- Intro -->
  <div class="clearfix xs-pb5">
    <p>
      Over the past 18 months years, I led design and user problems of a suite of
      internal dashboards at BuzzFeed that provides core data and insights to our
      editorial and business team.

      BuzzFeed creates over 600+ videos, posts and graphics a week.. We publish
      those content to our buzzfeed.com, 20+ different social media platforms, and
      track their performance data. Those data enables us to learn about the content
      our audience loves and hates, which power the content creation feedback
      loop: Create &#10141; Publish &#10141; Learn &#10141; Iterate.

<!-- why -->
  <div class="clearfix xs-pb5">
    <p class="xs-text-1 text-navy xs-text-display xs-text-center">Why invest our own analytic tools?</p>
    <ol class="xs-border-left xs-pl4">
        <li class="xs-pb2">
          Enable everyone from content creator and management with easy access to
          our giant well of data. Reduce the friction of access data from different
          sources and tools, hence speed up the feedback loop. We want people to
          spend more time on learning from data to learn and less time on cobbling
          data from different sources.
        </li>
        <li class="xs-pb2">
          Provide essential metrics of success to measure success across
          the board. With over 500 active data consumers, there are various degrees of
          knowledges within the org about how to best use data to make decision.
          While some team are strong domain expert, some teams resorted to a subjective
          ways to set goals and make tactical plans. A unified, hyper-focused tools
          that provides essential data that measure what are actually important to the
          success of our content, platforms, and company is an investment.

      about Béyonce?”
