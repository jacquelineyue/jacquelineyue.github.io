          Sequencing projects for a cross-disciplined team is a constant challenge. As part of a team that
          builds internal analytic tools, our projects often have multiple dependencies among ourselves or
          with other teams. Here is a life cycle of a typical project:
        </p>
        <p><img class="xs-mx-auto xs-py2" src="../images/impact-effort-dependency.png" /></p>
        <ul>
            <p class="xs-text-2 xs-ml0 xs-text-display xs-mb1">Challenge we face during prioritization:</p>
            <li>What is the logical sequence of the projects? </li>
            <li>How can we prioritize projects that are the most impactful to our users?</li>
            <li>We have limit back-end engineers available. Is there any task that requires no back-end work
              we can start to keep the project going forward?
            </li>
            <li>What are the quick-wins projects we can bang out quickly, so the users feel the continuous improvement of
            the product and our team feels the ongoing impact of their works?
            </li>
        </ul>

                What is the best way to evaluate many ideas simultaneously?
            </h1>
            Maybe just like a trading card game, each idea is given a score for its core values, which would allow
            us to compare the stats against each other, rank their importance, and determine which one to bet on.

        <p>
          To make prioritization easier, I create a simple method to evaluate each idea by visualizing user impact and
          effort with a scoring system. It is intended to quantify impact and effort for each project in a measurable way
          that allows us to compare them, and discuss/debate/negotiate their priority. This is how it works:

        <p>
            There are many roadmap methodologies on product management out there, but this simple
            Impact x Effort worksheet works for my team for a few reasons:
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Our users are also our co-workers. We know more visibility the internal user goals compared to
              external consumers, therefore more precise knowledge about the impact of our product.
            </li>
            <li>Transparency is the biggest win for us. For our team, the spreadsheet shows everyone why
              we purpuse certain projects and deprioritize others. For our management, the spreadsheet
              highlights our staffing needs by having the list of projects the team could have worked
              on if we have the more people. </li>
          <li>The Impact x Effort idea has inspired other teams across the BuzzFeed Tech organization to approach
            prioritization similarly and adapted the framework for their own needs. Here are examples of the
            prioritization from other teams:</li>
