<!-- Intro -->
  <div class="clearfix xs-pb5">
    <p>
      BuzzFeed creates over 600+ videos, posts, and graphics a week, publish them to BuzzFeed
      properties and social platforms, and track their performance data. The knowledge held
      in this data helps us to understand what content resonates with our readers. Therefore
      power the feedback loop (Create &#10141; Publish &#10141; Learn &#10141; Iterate.) for
      our content creators to make high quality, engaging content.
    </p>
  </div>

<!-- why -->
  <div class="clearfix xs-pb5">
    <p class="xs-text-xl xs-text-display xs-text-center">
      Why invest in our own analytic tools?
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li class="xs-pb2">
          Easy access to our vast data sources empowers our 1000 data consumers is invaluable.
          The tools help Reduce the friction of cobbling data from different sources and spend
          more time on learning, analyzing and make the decision. Hence speed up a feedback loop.
        </li>
        <li class="xs-pb2">
          Provide the baseline metrics and consistent point-of-views to measure success across
          the entire company. There is a various degree of knowledge about how to use data. We
          believe a hyper-focused tool will everyone to focus on the most important success metrics
          for our content, platforms, and company.
        </li>
        <li class="xs-pb2">
          Content experimentation is the bread and butter in the feedback loop process. Providing
          tools for content discovery and tagging will encourage people to experiment new narrative
          frame and storytelling to delight and engage our audience?

<!-- Process  -->
  <p class="xs-text-xl xs-text-display xs-text-center xs-pt5">
    So, what is the design process?
  </p>
  <p> Over the course of 18 months, I led design and user problems of a suite of
    12 internal dashboards at BuzzFeed that provides core data and insights to our
    editorial and business team. For each product and feature, the typical process
    goes like this:

<!-- Define -->
  <div class="clearfix xs-pb6">
    <p>
      <strong>Define the problems by deeply understanding the user and business needs.</strong>
      Methodology & tools used for this step include Research, interview, workflow/product audit,
      design workshop, diagraming, worksheets and thought exercises.

        BuzzFeed's Solid Pattern library) and Graph component.

<!-- Solution -->
  <p class="xs-text-xl xs-text-display xs-text-center xs-pt5">
    Different tools,  Different purposes
  </p>
  <p>In 18 months, El Dashboard suites has grown and expanded to 4 categories of tools: <strong>
    Content Insights, Signal, Discovery & Experiment,</strong>and <strong>Platform Health.</strong>
  </p>


<!-- Content insights -->

    <p>
      Content insights dashboards focus on provides the core metrics of a piece of content. Powered by a set
      of robust filters, search and sort functions, the table-based dashboard is efficient and flexible
      for exploring a large dataset. Users can look up “What are the most popular videos about Béyonce?”,
      “What are the most commented news post from last week?”, and then drill down to dive into the detail stats.

    <p>
      Even though looking up content performance has gotten a lot easier, it is still hard to discover
      the super viral content so our editorial team can quickly learn and go after the success.
      To surface any noteworthy insights, we built a few products that surface trending content in real-time
      and top performing content that broke the benchmark at 90th and above percentile. The
      visual-centric design for dashboards, badges, and slack notification enable users to identify the
      outliers quickly.

  <!-- OUTCOMES -->
    <p class="xs-text-xl xs-text-display xs-text-center">Outcomes</p>
    <p>El Dashboard continues to grow and thrive as the core analytic tools for the company.
      With over 500 active users a month, (35% of the entire organization), users are continuously
      relied on our tools to learn and make the data-driven decision every single day. The dashboard
      helps us to discover our users love food content, especially fluffy and jiggly dessert. </p>
  <!-- result -->

  <div class="clearfix xs-py5">
    <p class="xs-text-xl xs-text-display xs-text-center">What I learned (and am still learning)</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The perk of designing for internal users. We can have a very tight feedback loop to improve
        their products, opens to use "half-baked products" and gives us tons of feedbacks.
        We also know the ins-and-outs of their strategy changes and adapt our roadmap to meet their needs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Data is not just a simple number. I learned what a piece of data entails from the user and engineering
        perspective. Why is this number significant? Where is the number comes
        from? Which endpoint? At what frequency and granularity? Can we get it programmatically).
      </li>
      <li>
        Building a product is only half the battle. Onboarding, education and continuous retent our
        users is the other half.
