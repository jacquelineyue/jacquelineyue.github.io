      Sequencing the projects for a cross-disciplined team is a constant challenge. As part
      of a team that builds internal analytic tools, our projects often have multiple dependencies
      among ourselves and with other teams that are crisscross throughout the life cycle of
      product development:

    </p>
    <ul>
      <strong> Questions that came up often during our roadmap process</strong>
      <li>What is the logical sequence of the projects?</li>
      <li>How might we prioritize projects that are the most impactful to our users?</li>
      <li>The external backend team is our biggest dependency that often has limited bandwidth. Is there
        any task that requires no backend work we can start on to keep the project going forward?
      </li>
      <li>What are the quick-wins projects we can bang out quickly, so the users feel the continuous
        improvement of the product and our team feels the ongoing impact of their works?
      </li>
    </ul>

        What if each project is measured based on a universal scoring system, like a trading card game?
        This would help us to compare them against each other by weighting on their use impact and team effort.

      To make prioritization easier, I create a simple method to evaluate each idea by
      visualizing user impact and effort with a scoring system. It is intended to
      quantify impact and effort for each project in a measurable way that allows us to
      compare them, and discuss/debate/negotiate their priority. This is how it works:

  <p class="xs-text-2 sm-text-1 xs-text-display xs-text-center">Outcomes</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Transparency is the biggest win. After the putting in the estimate, it is very clear and
      easy to compare project by project, which project we should bet on, which project we can
      deprioritize. This also leaves no room for low-impact but laborious project, and hard to
      get our team advocate for it.</li>
    <li>An unintended outcome: The spreadsheet highlights our gap for staffing, so we can show what other projects
      we could have invested if we have more people.
    <li>The Impact x Effort idea has inspired other teams across the BuzzFeed tech to approach project
      prioritization similarly and adapted the spreadsheet.</li>
