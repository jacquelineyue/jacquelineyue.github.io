      <p>
        With an average of 30-40% completion rate, many games went on becomes a huge hit. This
        further validated that game format is a worthy investment to keep the BuzzFeed audiences
        engaged and entertained. After a 9-months experimentation phase, the strategy had shifted
        to increasing the game output by developing a more robust game-making tool that empowers
        more content creators to make games. The game team got dissolved as some members joined
        the bigger Content Managment System team to integrate the popular formats as part of the
        publishing tool.
