      Pound dashboard helps our clients and advertisers to gain insights about the virality of
      their sponsored content across the social web. The visualization maps a network of how one
      person shares content to another on social networks like Facebook & Twitter, as well
      as one-to-one sharing platforms like email & text.
    </p>
    <p>
      For each piece of content, the sharing pattern can inform the Reach of the content
      (size of the circle), and the engagement the content resonates within the audience group
      (darkness of the circle).

<!-- Exploration -->

    <p class="xs-text-1 text-navy xs-text-display xs-text-center">Explore</p>
    <p>
      Look through existing examples, I started by exploring ways to visualize the sharing network
      and drilling-down interaction. Collaborating with a super rad engineer to build a prototype
      with sample data, we quickly identify which visualization is the easiest to understand, and
      most feasible for rendering a dynamic dataset.

  <ul>
    <li>Pound dashboard was unsupported a year after its launch because of a shift of content
      consumption on various social platforms. I learned the importance of product vision and
      incremental scoping to better build a defensable product that can anticipate market change.
    </li>
    <li>How to productize a novel technology. Data is inherenly complex. Through the development of
      training guide for sale team, how to reduce everything into a elevator pitch.
