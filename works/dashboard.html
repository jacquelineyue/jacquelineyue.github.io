        <p>
            BuzzFeed creates and publishes over 500+ videos, posts, and graphics a week to our owned
            & operated properties and many social platforms like Facebook or Snapchat. We get data
            back about how our content connects with our audiences from metrics like pageviews,
            shares, and retweets. The knowledge held in this data helps us to understand what resonates
            with them; consequently powers the feedback loop: Create &#10141; Publish &#10141; Learn &#10141;
            Iterate.) for our content creators to make better, more engaging content.

            Data plays an integral role to our editorial and business strategy. My team Reporting Tools
            was formed 18 months ago and tasked with this mission:
            <span class="bold">
            Empower the entire organization to make data-driven decisions with a suite of analytic tools
            that are built by a dedicated team of product managers, engineers, designers and data-scientist
            that are hyper-focused and adaptable to meet the ever-changing needs from our editorial and
            business users.
            <span>
        </p>
        <p>
            As the sole designer in the Reporting Tools team, I lead the design and execution of all
            the dashboards, slack notification, and training collaterals. More recently, I also take on
            product mangement role in driving the strategy and vision for Search, Audience dashboard and
            improvements on the Content Insights dashboards.

          <p>The demand for data is growing drastically. Our data analysts were drowned by requests from different
              parts of the company and unable to keep up the demand. For the data consumers, accessing data was
              tedious. People spent more time hunting down data or cobbling stat from 3rd party tools and spreadsheets
              than making the analysis. Because of the high friction to access data, many folks gave up and resorted
              to subjective ways to set goals and make tactical decisions. There was no consistent way to measure
              content success that actually helps drive impact to the company.

              of robust filters, search and sorting, is efficient and flexible for exploring the large dataset.

                kill the dashboard shortly after its completion. Since then, our team learned to be
                critical of product decisions, and evaluated every project by the user impact and

            and operated and Facebook. As the audience's media consumption and the distributed platform is

            engagement metrics side-by-side. Most of the metrics have a strong correlation where the changes
            in one metric could reveal the changes in another. One of the novels features is pinning, which
            let users click and mark any date across all graphs so the user can compare the changes of those
            metrics across the same point in time.
