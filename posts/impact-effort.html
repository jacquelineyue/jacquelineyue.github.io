      Sequencing the projects for a cross-disciplined team is a constant challenge.
      As part of team that build internal analytic tools at BuzzFeed, most projects have
      multiple dependencies, both among ourselves and with other teams. Some key challenges are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>We got many ideas. Which projects we should work on first?</li>
      <li>How can we prioritize projects that are the most impactful to our users?</li>
      <li>We are low on engineering staffs. Is there tasks that requires no engineering
          to move the project forward?</li>
      <li>How long does this tasks actually takes end-to-end?
      <li>Good cadence! What are the quick-wins projects we can bang out while chipping away
          a big investment project, so the users feel the impact of the incremental  improvements
          and our team feels the continuous impact of their works?</li>
    </ul>

      This is where Impact x Effort framework comes in
    </p>
    <p>
      To help making an informative decision on prioritization, I create a simple framework
      that visualizes user impact and team effort by a simple scoring system.  It is intended to
      quantify "why" and "how"" of each project, compare them against the same metrics,
      and help negotiate their priority.

<!-- impact -->
  <div class="clearfix xs-text-serif xs-pb5">
    <p>
      <span class="bold text-2">Impact </span> quantify the “why” behind a product feature by asking two questions:</p>
    <p>
    <ul class="list-unstyled xs-border-left xs-pl4">
        <li class="bold">Who are the users?</li>
        <li>They are core user group you identify like Editorial, Sales, Marketing, Admin</li>
        <li class="bold xs-pt3">How useful is the feature to the users?</li>
        <li>😀 😀 😀 <span class="bold xs-pl1"> High </span>
          could be a feature for a task that users have no way to do now.
        </li>
        <li>😀 😀 <span class="bold xs-pl1">Medium </span> could be something
          that will save the users's time. </li>
        <li>😀  <span class="bold xs-pl1">Low </span> could be a small tweak that .</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <!-- effort -->
  <div class="clearfix xs-text-serif xs-pb5">
    <p>
      <span class="bold text-2">Effort</span> quantify the “how” behind a product feature based on 2 factors</p>
    <p>
    <ul class="list-unstyled xs-border-left xs-pl4">
        <li class="bold">What are the team effort?</li>
        <li>Design, product, engineering, data science, QA</li>
        <li class="bold xs-pt3">How many weeks does it takes?</li>
        <li>💻  <span class="bold xs-pl1">1 week</span></li>
    <ul>
  </div>

  <!-- total -->
  <div class="clearfix xs-text-serif xs-pb5">
    <p class="bold text-2">The total scores will inform the size of tasks and influence. For example:</p>
    <ul class="list-unstyled">
        <li><span class="bold">Many</span> 😀 😀 😀 <span class="xs-px1 bold">+ Few 💻</span> is a high impact,
          quick-win project. We should definitely do.</span></li>
        <li><span class="bold">Few</span> 😀 <span class="xs-px1 bold">+ many 💻 💻 💻</span> is a monolithic task
          that only benefits a small group of users. We probably won’t do or
          resort to no-build solution.</span></li>
        <li><span class="bold">Many</span> 😀 😀 😀 <span class="xs-px1 bold">+ many 💻 💻 💻</span> is an investment
          with strong user impact. It may worth the bet and prioritizing for.</span></li>
    <ul>
  </div>

<!-- outcome -->
<div class="clearfix xs-text-serif xs-pb5">
  <p class="xs-text-1 text-navy xs-text-display xs-text-center">Why does it work for us:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Our sprint is a week long, which maps roughly to each effort point  💻  .
      If a project requires more than 4 weeks , we will break it down further.  For example,
      a new checkout experience will probably take more than 4 weeks, maybe it can be broken
      into multiple stage like shipping, billing, confirmation.
    </li>
    <li>Effort point allowance adjusts for holiday and vacation. For example, with 2 engineers
      in the team, we have 8 💻  points a month. Say one of them will take a week off for vacation,
      the effort point will be down to 7. </li>
    <li>This framework is not about accurate estimation, as many software can do that.
      The purpose of the spreadsheet is about providing transparency to the team about the cadences,
      so we can set a meaningful milestone ahead instead of flying blind.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<!-- result -->
<div class="clearfix xs-text-serif xs-pb5">
  <p class="xs-text-1 text-navy xs-text-display xs-text-center">Result</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Transparency is the biggest win. After the putting in the estimate, it is very clear and
      easy to compare project by project, and  what we should bet on. This also leaves no room for
      low-impact but laborious project, and hard to get our team that advocate for it.
    </li>
    <li>Unintended outcome also help to identify resources gap are. We can justify to say these are
      the works we can also do if we have more resources. </li>
    <li>The Impact x Effort idea has inspired other teams across the BuzzFeed tech to approach
      project prioritization similarly and adapted the spreadsheet. </li>
  </ul>
