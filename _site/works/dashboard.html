            BuzzFeed creates and publishes over 600+ videos, posts, and graphics a week to our owned &
            operated properties and many social platforms like Facebook or Snapchat. We get data back about
            how our content connects with our audiences from metrics like pageviews, shares, and minutes watched.
            The knowledge held in those data helps us to understand what resonates with our audiences,
            and as a result, powers the feedback loop ( Iterate &#10141; Publish &#10141; Learn )
            for our content creators to make better, more engaging content.

            Data plays an integral role in our editorial and advertising strategy. My team Reporting Tools

              The demand for data is higher than ever. Our data analysts were drowned by requests
              from different parts of the company and unable to keep up the demand. For the data
              consumers, accessing data was tedious. People spent more time hunting down data
              or cobbling stats from 3rd party tools and spreadsheets than making data analysis.
              Because of the high friction to access data, many people simply gave up or resorted to
              a subjective way to set goals and make decisions. There was no consistent way
              to measure content success that actually helps drive impact.
