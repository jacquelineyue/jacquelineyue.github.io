          BuzzFeed content creators want to experiment ideas with simple, interactive formats
          that are engaging, shareable and fun. After the breakout success of the quiz format,
          our editors are looking for more playful ways to connect with the readers.
        </p>
        <p class="xs-text-display xs-text-2 sm-text-1">
          The goal is to design and build a collection of simple, turn-key action games for our
          editorial team that were super easy to create and adapt.
        </p>
        <p>
          Along three engineers, a producer, and an illustrator, I led the design and collaborated
          with editors to explore a wide range of light-weight game formats. Over the course of
          9 months, we developed 15 turn-key formats and prototyped over 60 game ideas.
          For the most popular games, we also created a backend game maker tool that allows
          content creators to generate their own games.

            With an average of 35-40% completion rate, many games went on becomes a huge hit. This
            validated that game format is a worthy investment to keep the BuzzFeed audiences engaged and

            After a 9-months experimentation phase, the product strategy had shifted to scale up the
            game output by developing a more robust game-making tool. The game team got dissolved as
            some of the OG team joined the bigger Content Managment System team to integrate the popular
            formats as part of the publishing workflow.
