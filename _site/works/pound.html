      <p class="xs-mb1 xs-mt4 bold">Situation</p>
        <p>
          BuzzFeed developed a proprietary <a class="link-charcoal" href="http://bzfd.it/2smIcq6">
          technology </a> called POUND (Process for Optimizing and Understanding Network Diffusion)
          that tracks how content was shared and spread across the social web. The knowledge held
          in this data could help us to understand our audiences as well as provide insights on
          what would make stories go viral on the web.
        </p>
        <p class="xs-mb1 xs-mt6 bold">Opportunity</p>
        <p>
          Create an exploratory dashboard that visualizes and measures how a piece of content
          spreaded around the social web that helps our editorial team and advertising partners
          to better understand our audienceâ€™s content consumption and sharing behavior, and guide
          them to make better, more engaging content to connect people.
        </p>
        <p class="xs-mb1 xs-mt6 bold">Solution</p>
        <p>
          POUND was first made available to a few advertisers in an iterative partnership. As the sole
          designer on the team, I worked closely with five engineers, two data scientists, two product
          managers and one project manager to create the data visualization and dashboard for our
          advertisers to explore data around their paid contents.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Exploration -->
    <div class="clearfix xs-py6">
        <p class="xs-text-1 xs-text-display xs-text-center">Explore the Visualization</p>
        <p>
            The visualization is the core piece of the dashboard. I started the design by
            researching the existing D3 models that show a network of nodes and sub-nodes.
            I collaborated with an engineer to build out several prototypes with sample data
            and quickly identified the packed circle graph was the most intuitive design to
            Users, and the most feasible for rendering a large, dynamic dataset.
            <img class="xs-text-center xs-mx-auto" src="../images/pound-viz-explore.png" />
        </p>
        <p class="bold xs-mt6 xs-mb1">Color of the circle</p>
        <p>
            The sharing network of a piece of content is represented in a cluster of circles.
            Each circle represents a promotion source that ignites the sharing downstream.
            A promotion source could be a BuzzFeed promotion (red), Facebook promotion (dark blue),
            Tweet (light blue), or newsletter link (gray).
        </p>
        <p><img class="xs-mx2 xs-text-center" src="../images/pound-darkness.png" /></p>
        <p class="bold xs-mt6 xs-mb1">Size and brightness/darkness</p>
        <p>
            The size of the circle represents the number of shares that particular promotion
            source has produced in totals. The shade of the circle represents the number of re-shares
            downstream.
        </p>
        <p><img class="xs-mx2 xs-text-center" src="../images/pound-size-depth.png" /></p>
        <p class="xs-mt6">
            Together, they show the reach and engagement of the content. The bigger the circle,
            the higher the reach; the darker the circle, the deeper the engagement.

        <p>The dashboard enables our advertisers to drill down to each promotion source and see the key metrics
          (Propagation, Penetration, and Sharability) that attributes the content virality. Users can also
          filter to see the network effect on particular platforms (Facebook app, BuzzFeed app, BuzzFeed site)
          or devices. (Mobile web, mobile app, Desktop)</p>

          Partnering with the project manager and product manager, we put together
          an onboarding guide to train our Client Services team who would be guiding
          our advertisers and clients to explore the data using the dashboard.

      <p>
        The Pound dashboard and technology received positive feedback from our advertisers
        and helped BuzzFeed to position themselves as a data-driven publishing partner to our clients.
        However, due to a market shift in the content consumption, the dashboard got sunsetted.
        Despite that, I have learned a lot about what it takes to transform a raw dataset into
        an actionable tool that helps to solve a problem. I also learned how to explain a complex
        idea using design and storytelling.
