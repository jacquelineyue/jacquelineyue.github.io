        <p>
            BuzzFeed creates and publishes over 500+ videos, posts, and graphics a week to our owned &
            operated properties and many social platforms like Facebook or Snapchat. We get data back about
            how our content connects with our audiences from metrics like pageviews, shares, and retweets.
            The knowledge held in this data helps us to understand what resonates with them; consequently
            powers the feedback loop ( Create &#10141; Publish &#10141; Learn ) for our content creators to
            make better, more engaging content.

            Data plays an integral role in our editorial and advertising strategy. My team Reporting Tools
            was formed 2 years ago and tasked with this mission:
        </p>
        <p class="xs-text-display xs-text-1">
            Empower the organization to make data-driven decisions with a suite of analytic tools
            built by a dedicated team that are hyper-focused and adaptable to meet the ever-changing
            needs.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the sole designer in the Reporting Tools team, I lead the design and execution of all the
            dashboards, push notifications, and product marketing collaterals. For the last year, I am the
            product manager in driving the strategy and vision for Audience and Content Insights products.

              The demand for data is higher than ever. Our data analysts were drowned by requests
              from different parts of the company and unable to keep up the demand. For the data
              consumers, accessing data was tedious. People spent more time hunting down data
              or cobbling stat from 3rd party tools and spreadsheets than making the analysis.
              Because of the high friction to access data, many folks gave up and resorted to
              subjective ways to set goals and make tactical decisions. There was no consistent way
              to measure content success that actually helps drive impact to the company.

              The content insights dashboards addressed those pain points by providing key metrics
              for a given piece of content. Given the high volume of data for content insights,
              the design goal for those products is to focus on efficiency and clarify. The table-based
              design powered by a set of robust filters, search and sorting, is efficient and
              flexible for exploring the large dataset. Users can look up ‚ÄúWhat are the most popular
              videos about B√©yonce?‚Äù and then drill down to dive into the detail stas.

                The unclear use case along with the unforeseen engineering challenge forced us to
                kill the dashboard shortly after its completion. Since then, our team learned to be
