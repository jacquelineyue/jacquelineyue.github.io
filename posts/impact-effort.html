      Sequencing the projects for a cross-disciplined team is a constant challenge. As part
      of a team that builds internal analytic tools, our projects often have multiple
      dependencies among ourselves and with other teams that are crisscross throughout the
      life cycle of a product development:
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <ul>
      <strong> Questions we ask during prioritization</strong>
      <li>What is the logical sequence of the project? </li>
      <li>How can we prioritize projects that are the most impactful to our users? </li>
      <li>The backend team has little bandwidth. Is there any task that requires
        no backend the rest of the team can work on to keep the project going forward?</li>
      <li>What are the quick-wins projects we can bang out, so the users feel the
        continuous improvement of the product and our team feels the ongoing impact
        of their works?
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      To make prioritization easier, I create a simple method to evaluate each idea by <strong>
      visualizing user impact and effort </strong> with a scoring system. It is intended to
      quantify impact and effort for each project in a measurable way that allows us to
      compare them, and discuss/debate/negotiate their priority.

<!-- impact -->
  <div class="clearfix xs-pb5">
      <p><span class="bold text-1">Impact</span>
        is the “why” behind a product feature with two questions:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-unstyled xs-border-left xs-pl4">
          <li><span class="bold xs-pr1">Who are the users? </span></li>
          <li>They are the different type of users you identify.</li>
          <li class="bold xs-pr1 xs-pt3">How useful is the feature to the users?</li>
          <li>😀 😀 😀 High – means a feature that users have no way to do now.</li>
          <li>😀 😀 Medium – means be something that will save the users's time.</li>
          <li>😀 Low – means a nice-to-have improvement.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><img class="xs-mx-auto" src="../images/impact-effort-impact.png" /></p>
  </div>

  <!-- effort -->
  <div class="clearfix xs-pb5">
    <p><span class="bold text-1">Effort</span> quantify the “how” behind a product
      feature with two questions:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-unstyled xs-border-left xs-pl4">
        <li class="bold">What are the team effort?</li>
        <li>Design, product, engineering, data science, infrastrusture...etc.</li>
        <li class="bold xs-pt3">How long does it take?</li>
        <li>💻 you can estimate by the number of weeks </span></li>
    </ul>
    <p><img class="xs-mx-auto" src="../images/impact-effort-effort.png" /></p>
  </div>

  <!-- total -->
  <div class="clearfix xs-pb5">
    <p class="bold text-2">The total scores will inform the size of tasks and influence. For example:</p>
    <ul class="list-unstyled">
        <li>😀 😀 😀 💻  High impact, low effort = this is a quick-win
          task. We should definitely do.</li>
        <li>😀 💻 💻 💻  Low impact, high effort = this is a monolithic
          task with little benefits. Probably
          won’t do right away or resort to non-build solution.</li>
        <li>😀 😀 😀 💻 💻 💻  High impact, High effort = this is an
          investment that may worth the bet.</li>
    <ul>
  </div>

<!-- outcome -->
<div class="clearfix xs-pb5">
  <p class="xs-text-1 text-navy xs-text-display xs-text-center">Does it work?</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Transparency is the biggest win. After the putting in the estimate, it is very clear and
      easy to compare project by project, which project we should bet on, which project we can
      deprioritize. This also leaves no room for low-impact but laborious project, and hard to
      get our team advocate for it.</li>
    <li>An unintended outcome: The spreadsheet highlights our gap for staffing, so we can show what other projects
      we could have invested if we have more people.
    <li>The Impact x Effort idea has inspired other teams across the BuzzFeed tech to approach project
      prioritization similarly and adapted the spreadsheet.</li>
