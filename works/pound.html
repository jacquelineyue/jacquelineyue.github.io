        Pound dashboard helps our clients and advertisers to gain insights about the virality of
        their sponsored content across the social web. The visualization maps a network of how one
        person shares content to another on social networks like Facebook & Twitter, as well
        as one-to-one sharing platforms like email & text.
      </p>
      <p>
        For each piece of content, the sharing pattern can inform the Reach of the content
        (size of the circle), and the engagement the content resonates within the audience group
        (darkness of the circle).

        Look through existing examples, I started by exploring ways to visualize the sharing network
        and drilling-down interaction. Collaborating with a super rad engineer to build a prototype
        with sample data, we quickly identify which visualization is the easiest to understand, and
        most feasible for rendering a dynamic dataset.

        Along with a project manager and product manager, I put together an onboarding guide and provided
        training for our the Sale team and Client Services team to learn about the POUND metrics and use
        the insights to clients.

        <li class="xs-pb2">
          Pound dashboard was unsupported a year after launch because of a market shift
          in content consumption on social platforms. I learned the importance of validating
          an idea against business and market needs early on, and scoping for incremental
          product development that is flexible to adopt changes.
        </li>
        <li class="xs-pb2">
          Designing data visualization for a large, dynamic dataset is different than
          for static dataset because of unforeseen performance and edge cases. I was fortunate
          to have a close engineering partner to try out a few prototypes with sample data and
          iterates the design onward to reduce speculation.
        </li>
        <li class="xs-pb2">
          I also learn how to productize a novel technology, develop a concise sale pitch as
          possible through design, storytelling, and metaphor that help to make an idea stick.
