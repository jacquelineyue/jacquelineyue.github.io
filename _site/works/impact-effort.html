            Sequencing projects for a cross-disciplined team of 12 is a constant challenge.
            As the lead of a team that builds internal analytic tools for 600 MAUs, our projects
            often have multiple dependencies either among ourselves or with another team.
            Here is a typical life cycle of a product:
        </p>
        <p><img class="xs-mx-auto xs-py2" src="../images/impact-effort-dependency.png" /></p>
        <p class="xs-mb1 xs-mt4 bold">The problems we face during prioritization:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> What is the logical sequence to execute this product? </li>
            <li> How can we prioritize projects that are the most impactful to our users? </li>
            <li> We have limit backend engineers available. Is there any task that requires no
              backend work we can do to keep the project going forward?
            </li>
            <li>What are the quick-win tasks we can bang out, so our users feel the continuous
              improvement of the product and our team feels the ongoing impact of their works?
            </li>

        <p>Like in trading card game, what if each project is given a score for its core values?
          This would help us to compare their strength and weakness stats against each other,
          rank their importance, and determine which one to pursue or descope. </p>

            To make prioritization transparent and easy, I create a simple method to
            evaluate a bunch of ideas by visualizing its user impact and team effort
            with a scoring system. Here is how it works:

    <!-- total -->
    <article class="clearfix xs-py6 xs-border-top-lighter">
        <p class="xs-my0">
          The total scores generally informs the size and influence of the project. For example:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li class="xs-py2">ðŸ˜€ ðŸ˜€ ðŸ˜€ ðŸ’»

                This is a quick-win task. We should definitely do.
            </li>
            <li class="xs-py2">ðŸ˜€ ðŸ’» ðŸ’» ðŸ’»
                <span class="bold xs-px1">Low impact, high effort </span>
                This is a monolithic task with little upsides. Probably wonâ€™t do right away or resort to
                a non-build solution.
            </li>
            <li class="xs-py2">ðŸ˜€ ðŸ˜€ ðŸ˜€ ðŸ’» ðŸ’» ðŸ’»
                <span class="bold xs-px1">High impact, High effort</span>
                This is an investment that may worth the bet.

    <!-- outcome -->

        <p>
            There are many prioritization methodologies on product management out there, but the
            simplicity of the Impact x Effort worksheet meets our need for a few reasons:
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
              Our team builds internal tools. Our users are also our co-workers, which means
              we have visibility of their goal and feedback about our product, which helps us
              to determine user priority.
            </li>
            <li>
              Transparency is the biggest win for us. The spreadsheet makes it crystal clear
              why we should work on a project or not. For our management, the spreadsheet also
              highlights our staffing gaps by seeing the list of projects the team could have
              worked on if we have the more people.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Impact x Effort idea has inspired other teams across the BuzzFeed tech to
              approach prioritization similarly and adapted the ideas for their needs. Here are
              examples of the prioritization spreadsheet from other teams: </li>
