    <div class="clearfix xs-pb5 ">
      <p>
        With over a decade of multi-disciplinary design experience and leadership, I work with
        small business to multinational organizations to design engaging, actionable
        products for news media, games and data analystic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently at <a class="link-charcoal" target="_blank" href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/">
        BuzzFeed</a>, I lead the design and product problems for a suite of internal
        analytic tools that empowers 500+ employees with data for learning and experimentation.
        In the day-to-day, I design flow and ui details, run user research, manage products,
        analyze usage data, write codes, mentor designers and co-lead a cross-disciplined team.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy turning nebulous concepts into buildable solutions, and empowering tool users
        as well as my team to do their best work. While not working,
        I <a class="link-charcoal" target="_blank" href="http://iliketothrowthings.tumblr.com/">
        throw things</a> and <a class="link-charcoal" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/eskedoodle/">
        explore system design </a> with my son.
