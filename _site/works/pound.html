        <p>
          BuzzFeed developed a proprietary tracking <a class="link-charcoal" href="http://bzfd.it/2smIcq6"> technology </a>
          called POUND (Process for Optimizing and Understanding Network Diffusion) that measures and traces how
          content was shared and spread across the social web. The knowledge held in this data could help us to
          understand our content, our audiences as well as provide insights on what makes a story go viral.
        </p>
        <p class="xs-mb1 xs-mt6 bold">Solution</p>
        <p>
          Create an exploratory dashboard that visualizes and measures the magnitude of a piece of content travels around
          the social web. This helps users to understand our audience's consumption and sharing behavior, and guide our editorial
          team and advertising partners to make better, more engaging story to connect people.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
          POUND was first made available to a few advertisers in an iterative partnership. As the sole design lead,
          I worked closely with five engineers, two data scientists, two product managers and one project manager to
          create the visualization and dashboard for our advertisers to explore data around their paid contents.
        </p>

    <!-- Exploration -->
    <div class="clearfix xs-py6">
        <p class="xs-text-1 xs-text-display xs-text-center">Explore the Visualization</p>
        <p>
            Visualization is the core piece of the dashboard. I started the design by researching the existing D3 models
            that show a network of nodes and sub-nodes. I collaborated with an engineer to build out several prototypes
            with sample data and quickly identified the packed circle graph is the most intuitive to people, and most
            feasible for rendering a large, dynamic dataset.
            <img class="xs-text-center xs-mx-auto" src="../images/pound-viz-explore.png" />
        </p>
        <p class="bold xs-mt6 xs-mb1">Color of the circle</p>
        <p>
            The sharing pattern of a piece of content is represented in a cluster of circles. Each circle represents
            a promotion source that ignites the sharing downstream. A promotion source could be a BuzzFeed promotion
            (red), Facebook promotion (dark blue), Tweet (light blue), or newsletter link (gray).
        </p>
        <p><img class="xs-mx2 xs-text-center" src="../images/pound-darkness.png" /></p>
        <p class="bold xs-mt6 xs-mb1">Size and brightness/darkness</p>
        <p>
            The size of the circle represents the number of shares that particular promotion has produced in totals.
            The shade of the circle represents the number of re-shares downstream.
        </p>
        <p><img class="xs-mx2 xs-text-center" src="../images/pound-size-depth.png" /></p>
        <p class="xs-mt6">
            Together, they show the reach and engagement depth of the content. The bigger the circle,
            the higher the reach; the darker the circle, the deeper the engagement.

        <p>The dashboard enables our advertisers to drill down to each promotion source and see the key metrics
          (Propagation, Penetration, and Sharability) that attributes the content virality. Users can also
          filter to see the network effect on particular platforms (Facebook app, BuzzFeed app, BuzzFeed site)
          or devices. (Mobile web, mobile app, Desktop)</p>

            Pound Dashboard got sunset because of a market shift in content consumption on social platforms. Despite
            the positive reaction of the design, the viability of the product itself was in question. I learned a lot
            about building data product, how infrastructure could affect the product downstream. I also learned a lot
            about "ptiching" a novel technology to through design, storytelling, and metaphor in order to make a
            concept stick.
