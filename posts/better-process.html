        <li>How can we prioritize projects that are the most impactful to our users?</li>
        <li>We are low on engineering staffs. Is there tasks that requires no engineering
            to move the project forward?</li>
        <li>How long does this tasks actually takes end-to-end?
        <li>Good cadence! What are the quick-wins projects we can bang out while chipping away
            a big investment project, so the users feel the impact of the incremental  improvements
            and our team feels the continuous impact of their works?</li>
